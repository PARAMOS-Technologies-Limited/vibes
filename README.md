# Hovel

A development environment API that spins up an AI agent-powered workspace, featuring an embeddable web terminal interface for seamless integration into web applications.

## Overview

Hovel is a Flask-based API server that provides a complete development environment management system. It includes advanced branch management capabilities that allow you to create isolated development environments for different features or experiments.

## Features

- **Main API Server**: Flask-based REST API with comprehensive endpoints
- **Branch Management System**: Create isolated development environments for different features
- **Docker Integration**: Full Docker support with automatic containerization
- **Git Integration**: Automatic git branch creation and management
- **Environment Isolation**: Each branch runs on its own port with complete environment isolation
- **Web Terminal Interface**: Embeddable terminal for web applications

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- Git (optional, for branch management)

### Running with Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd hovel

# Start the main API server
docker-compose up
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Running Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
python server.py
```

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- `GET /` - Server information and status
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/status` - API status and available endpoints
- `GET /api/data` - Sample data endpoint
- `POST /api/process` - Data processing endpoint

### Branch Management Endpoints

- `POST /api/branch` - Create a new development branch
- `GET /api/branches` - List all created branches

## Development

### Creating a New Branch

```bash
# Create a new development branch
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/branch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"branch_name": "feature-new-ui"}'

# Run the branch application
python run_branch.py feature-new-ui
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run the test suite
python test_branch_system.py
```

## Configuration
