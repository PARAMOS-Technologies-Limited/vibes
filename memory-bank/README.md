This directory contains comprehensive documentation and lessons learned for AI agents working on the Hovel project. Use these resources to understand the project architecture, troubleshoot issues, and follow best practices.

## üìö Available Resources

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Guides
- **[Python Environment Troubleshooting](python-environment-troubleshooting.md)** - Complete guide to resolving Python environment and Flask installation issues in containerized environments
- **[Flask Server Startup Guide](flask-server-startup-guide.md)** - Step-by-step instructions for starting Flask servers with troubleshooting flows

### üìã Project Planning
- **[Comprehensive Project Plan](project-plan-comprehensive.md)** - Complete project roadmap covering architecture, API specs, Docker setup, development workflow, and future enhancements

## üéØ Quick Reference for AI Agents

### When Starting the Server
1. Check [Flask Server Startup Guide](flask-server-startup-guide.md) for the correct startup sequence
2. If you encounter ModuleNotFoundError, refer to [Python Environment Troubleshooting](python-environment-troubleshooting.md)
3. Use `/usr/local/bin/python3.11 server.py` as the recommended startup command

### When Troubleshooting Issues
1. **ModuleNotFoundError**: Check Python installations and use specific binary paths
2. **SSL Issues**: Install system SSL packages (libssl-dev, python3-openssl, ca-certificates)
3. **External Environment Management**: Use virtual environments or specific Python binaries

### When Planning Development
1. Review [Comprehensive Project Plan](project-plan-comprehensive.md) for architecture and API specifications
2. Follow the documented directory structure and development workflow
3. Reference the future enhancements roadmap for feature planning

## üîç Search Keywords

Use these keywords to quickly find relevant information:

- **Python environment**: Environment setup, SSL issues, virtual environments
- **Flask server**: Startup commands, troubleshooting, configuration
- **Docker**: Container setup, SSL dependencies, environment isolation
- **API endpoints**: REST API, branch management, health checks
- **Development workflow**: Cursor.dev integration, testing, deployment
- **Architecture**: System design, directory structure, technology stack

## üìñ How to Use This Knowledge Base

### For New AI Agents
